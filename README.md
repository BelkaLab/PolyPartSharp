#### PolyPartSharp
A .NET port, in C#, of the lightweight C++ library for polygon partition and triangulation.

This project is in its initial stages so it may be a little rough such as only the ear clipping algorithm have being ported.
The library may be subject to change in the near future to cleanup the code and make things more .NET style.

See the original [project page](https://github.com/ivanfratric/polypartition) for more details on the library itself.

###Demo Project
The demo project *PolyDemo* uses [eto](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) for the UI.
Left click to place a vertex and when finished press middle mouse to triangulate, and press right mouse at any time to clear.
